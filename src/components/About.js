                <h2 className='about-form-h2'>our identity</h2>

                <p className='about-form-p'>
                    Ocho Trece originates from an Hispanic reference of the Latin community to Tampa
                    Bay’s main telephone area code. Tampa Bay Metro area is recognized as the “813” all
                    throughout the vicinities across the state of Florida. Therefore, we are combining our
                    local Tampa Bay area, where this culinary endeavor was born with an expression of
                    the Hispanic heritage; a cultural ethnicity that not only represents both our co-
                    founders but also the largest minority group in the Tampa Bay area and the State of
                    Florida. Our locally founded Restaurant will create an immediate sense of belonging
                    with our community that embraces one of the core values on which the venture of
                    our business was created, Identity. That Identity reunites cultural and social beliefs
                    that are deeply tied with our everyday actions, we have transferred those beliefs and
                    combined them together with touches of culinary backgrounds and extracts from
                    other cultures to create the concept we are presenting today. We do not see our
                    restaurant as a place our customers come only to enjoy a meal; we see it as an all-
                    round location, a gathering spot where you are not only having a delicious dining
                    experience but sharing who and what you are as person with your close ones.
