                <p className='about-form-p'>
                    ocho trece originates from a reference of the latin community to tampa bay’s main telephone area code, “813”.  this culinary endeavor was born from an expression of this hispanic heritage, a cultural ethnicity that not only represents both our co- founders but also a very large and vibrant part of the tampa bay and florida identity. our local restaurant will create an immediate sense of belonging with our community that embraces one of the core values on which our business was created, identity. that identity unites cultural and social beliefs that are deeply tied to our everyday actions. we have transferred those beliefs and combined them  with touches of culinary backgrounds and extracts from other cultures to create the concept presented today.  our restaurant is not only a place our customers come to enjoy a meal, we see it as an all- round location, a gathering spot where you are not only having a delicious dining experience, but sharing who and what you are with your closest ones.
